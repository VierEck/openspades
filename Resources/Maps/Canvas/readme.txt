the maps in this pak are Canvases. They are not being overwritten, 
but only loaded to create a new map. Maps are being saved in UserResources. 

You may find your UserResources in AppData. 


use a heightmap editor to create a new "Canvas" with different colors or textures or with entire Terrain.
u can then add them to this pak to use as Canvas in future projects.
